    "Easy21 is a simple card game similar to Blackjack:\n",
    "- Each card is drawn from an infinite deck, with even distributed value between 1 and 10 and a color of red (P[red] = 1/3) or black (P[black] = 2/3)\n",
    "- At beginning both player and dealer draw a black card (observed)\n",
    "- At each turn player either stick or hit\n",
    "- Value of cards is sum of value of black cards minus sum of value of red cards\n",
    "- If player value exceeds 21 or becomes less than 1 they loose\n",
    "- Once player sticks, dealer draws. If value 17 or greater, dealer sticks. If dealer goes bust as above, player wins. Otherwise, highest value wins.\n",
